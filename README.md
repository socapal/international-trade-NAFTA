# The Increase in MEX-USA trade after NAFTA 1990-2005.
Our visualization project focuses on the analysis of the trade relationship between Mexico and the United States. Our data goes from 1990 up to 2005, paying particular attention to the changes after the North American Free Trade Agreement on 1994. In order to do so, we use trade data generated by both countries.
